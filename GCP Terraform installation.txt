To create a Virtual Machine (VM) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform on an Ubuntu machine, you need to follow several steps, including installing Terraform, configuring Google Cloud credentials, writing the Terraform configuration, and applying it. Below is a detailed guide to achieve this.

Step 1: Install Google Cloud SDK
Before using Terraform to create resources on GCP, you need to authenticate using your Google Cloud credentials.

Install the Google Cloud SDK:

Run the following commands to install the Google Cloud SDK on Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install google-cloud-sdk
Authenticate your GCP account:

Once the SDK is installed, authenticate your account:

bash
Copy code
gcloud auth login
Follow the instructions to log in via your browser.

Set the default project (replace your-project-id with your actual GCP project ID):

bash
Copy code
gcloud config set project your-project-id
Set up Application Default Credentials (to be used by Terraform):

bash
Copy code
gcloud auth application-default login
Step 2: Install Terraform
You can install Terraform on Ubuntu using the following steps:

Install Terraform:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install terraform
Verify the installation: After installation, verify Terraform is installed by running:

bash
Copy code
terraform -v
Step 3: Configure Terraform
Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration:

bash
Copy code
mkdir gcp-terraform-vm
cd gcp-terraform-vm
Create the Terraform configuration file (main.tf): Inside the gcp-terraform-vm directory, create a main.tf file with the following content to define your Google Cloud VM.

main.tf:

hcl
Copy code
# Configure the Google Cloud provider
provider "google" {
  project = "your-project-id"   # Replace with your project ID
  region  = "us-central1"       # Change to your desired region
}

# Create a VM instance
resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  name         = "example-vm"
  machine_type = "e2-medium"     # Change to your desired machine type
  zone         = "us-central1-a" # Change to your desired zone
  image        = "debian-11-bullseye-v20221205" # OS image (you can choose other images as well)

  # Network configuration
  network_interface {
    network = "default"
    access_config {}  # Assigns a public IP to the VM
  }

  tags = ["example-vm"]

  metadata = {
    ssh-keys = "your-username:ssh-rsa YOUR_SSH_KEY"
  }
}

# Output the VM's external IP
output "instance_ip" {
  value = google_compute_instance.example.network_interface[0].access_config[0].nat_ip
}
In this configuration:

Replace "your-project-id" with your actual GCP project ID.
Replace "YOUR_SSH_KEY" with your actual SSH public key.
The image specified is a Debian-based image; you can change it to another OS like Ubuntu or CentOS if needed.
Note: To get your SSH key, run the following command to generate an SSH key if you don't already have one:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Then, copy the public key:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Step 4: Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform working directory: Run the following command in the directory where your main.tf file is located:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
This will download the necessary provider plugins for Google Cloud.

Step 5: Plan the Deployment
Generate an execution plan: Before applying the changes, run the following command to see what Terraform will do:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
This will show you the resources Terraform is going to create.

Step 6: Apply the Configuration
Apply the Terraform configuration: Run the following command to apply the configuration and create the VM:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
When prompted, type yes to approve the changes. Terraform will then create the VM on GCP.

Step 7: Check the Output
Once the deployment is complete, Terraform will display the external IP of the created VM, like this:

bash
Copy code
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_ip = "34.123.45.67"
You can now SSH into the VM using the external IP:

bash
Copy code
ssh your-username@34.123.45.67 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 8: Destroy the Resources (Optional)
If you want to delete the VM and other resources created by Terraform, run:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
You will be prompted to confirm the destruction by typing yes.

Conclusion
You have successfully created a VM on GCP using Terraform on your Ubuntu machine.
You can modify the Terraform configuration (main.tf) to customize the VM, such as changing the machine type, OS image, or adding more resources.
